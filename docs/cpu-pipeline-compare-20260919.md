# Indexed compare/test pipeline candidate

AP040_PIPELINE_COMPARE enables brief indexed CMP/TST and register TST.
The module parameter ENABLE_COMPARE defaults to0. Indexed reads retain
the existing ordered memory/fault path, compute flags without writing any
register, and compare against the third RF operand (not the EA index).
QSF selects compare with P6, targeted memory entry and final-WB early drain.
The previously rejected displacement-MOVE and experimental call extensions
are excluded.

Exact promoted validation artifacts: `scratch/compare_promoted_20260919`
and `scratch/compare_promoted_*.log`.

- Memory oracle:13,166retirements and5,120indexed requests per each of8
  latency/CE schedules; all match independent address/value/CCR/register data.
- ALU oracle:63,576retirements per each of6schedules, including registerTST.
- Both deliberate errors (wrong CMP operand and erroneous register writeback)
  are caught by semantic trace differences.
- CMP/TST extension faults, trace and IRQ:all6cases pass under actual
  memory-entry/early-drain policy without FORCE_DECODE.
- CMP/TST operand faults:bothcases×3phases pass with precise framePC600,
  faultaddressf140,CCR and unchanged destination/index/base registers.
- Forced architectural reference:14,720retirements/commits match.
- First100silicon records:1,900fieldgroups,zero differences; artifacts
  `/tmp/cpu-corpus100-gate.UX8DIV`. This is not the full silicon corpus.
- Full normal integration gate terminalPASS: all14legacy suites, memory/PEA
  fault/trace cases, and4precise IRQ/replay monitors.

Independent runners are tracked as scripts/cpu/pipeline_compare_*;
`pipeline_handoff.py` accepts --compare alongside --early-drain, --memory-entry
and existing pipeline options. Corpus runner adds CPU_GATE_PIPELINE_COMPARE=1.
The normal prototype/reference also compiles with compare disabled.

All measured exact-kernel runs preserve their result/guard checks.

| Kernel, controlled RAM latency3 | Prior90b37e4 | Combined candidate |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Towers | 26,600,632 | 26,256,329 |

Towers improves1.29%, Bubble3.25%, Permute essentially unchanged. These are
CPU-wrapper diagnostics, not a hardware Mix forecast. Bubble uses the
original sorting-loop bytes with a fixed shuffled500-word input and excludes
its allocation/initialization/five-iteration wrapper.

Next fit archive scratch/p7compare_fit_20260919; service
q800-p7compare-fit-20260919.service. Commit before launch and freeze RTL/QSF/
QIP/SDC until terminal flow and cross-domain extraction. No new hardware score
or fit claim exists yet. Latest measured hardware median1.003 remains below1.8.
