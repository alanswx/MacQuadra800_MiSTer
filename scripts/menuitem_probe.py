`title_left_x` is the second field from scripts/menubar_probe.py: a Mac OS menu
panel is left-aligned with its title.

Detection is by colour, not brightness. The panel is neutral grey (R=G=B, light),
the highlighted row is the appearance blue (measured: rgb ~ (84,84,179), so
B - R is large), and the desktop below the panel is teal (G,B > R). Brightness
alone cannot separate a blue highlight from the dark desktop, which is what an
earlier greyscale version of this got wrong.

Used by scripts/mac_shutdown.sh to confirm that Shut Down -- the LAST item of
the Special menu -- is the highlighted row before the button is released,
because Restart is the row directly above it.
